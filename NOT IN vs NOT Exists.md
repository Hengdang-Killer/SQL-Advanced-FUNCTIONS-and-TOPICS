# Comparison of `NOT IN` vs `NOT EXISTS`

## NOT IN :-

`NOT IN` checks whether a value is not within a set of values returned by a subquery.

### Advantages of `NOT IN` :-

1. **Simplicity :-**
   - `NOT IN` is straightforward and easy to understand, making it readable for simple cases where direct comparisons are sufficient.

2. **Use in Simple Queries :-**
   - Ideal for simple scenarios with direct list comparisons, like filtering out a set of values directly.

### Disadvantages of `NOT IN` :-

1. **NULL Handling :-**
   - If the subquery returns any `NULL` values, the entire `NOT IN` condition fails because comparisons involving `NULL` are treated as unknown. This can lead to unexpected results or no rows being returned at all.

2. **Performance with Large Datasets :-**
   - `NOT IN` can perform poorly with large datasets because it requires a scan of all values to check for the existence of each value.
   - It is less efficient with subqueries involving joins or when the list returned by the subquery is very large.

3. **Index Utilization :-**
   - Databases may struggle to optimize `NOT IN` queries, especially if the subquery does not use an index effectively, leading to slower performance.

## NOT EXISTS :-

`NOT EXISTS` checks whether no rows are returned by a subquery.

### Advantages of `NOT EXISTS` :-

1. **Better Performance with Joins :-**
   - `NOT EXISTS` is generally more efficient with subqueries involving joins because it stops searching as soon as it finds a matching row, rather than scanning the entire list.
   - It can be better optimized by the database engine, especially with correlated subqueries.

2. **NULL Safety :-**
   - `NOT EXISTS` handles `NULL` values correctly. It does not fail due to `NULL` values in the subquery, as it only checks for the presence or absence of rows, not specific values.

3. **Readable for Complex Queries :-**
   - It makes complex queries involving multiple conditions and correlations more readable and logically structured.

### Disadvantages of `NOT EXISTS` :-

1. **Complexity :-**
   - Slightly more complex to understand and write for beginners compared to `NOT IN`, especially when involving correlated subqueries.

2. **Potential Overhead :-**
   - For very simple cases or direct value comparisons, `NOT EXISTS` might introduce unnecessary overhead compared to `NOT IN`.

## Performance Comparison :-

- **For Large Datasets and Joins :-**
  - `NOT EXISTS` usually outperforms `NOT IN` due to better optimization by database engines in handling joins and correlated subqueries.
  
- **For Small Datasets or Direct Comparisons :-**
  - Both `NOT IN` and `NOT EXISTS` perform similarly, with `NOT IN` being simpler for direct value comparisons.

## When to Use Which :-

- **Use `NOT IN` When :-**
  - Dealing with simple, direct comparisons where `NULL` values are not a concern.
  - Performance is not critical, and the dataset size is relatively small.

- **Use `NOT EXISTS` When :-**
  - Working with complex queries, especially involving joins and correlations.
  - There are potential `NULL` values in the subquery.
  - Performance is important, especially with large datasets.

## Summary :-

- `NOT EXISTS` is generally more robust and performs better with complex conditions, handling `NULL` values correctly.
- `NOT IN` is simpler but can be unreliable with `NULL` values and less efficient with large or complex subqueries.

Choosing between `NOT IN` and `NOT EXISTS` depends on the specific requirements of your query, the data involved, and the performance considerations.
